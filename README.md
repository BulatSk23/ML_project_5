Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Input convex Neural Networks

Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNN) were used on Toy Datasets, for Multi-Label Classification and for Face Image Completion tasks.

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) was used together with ICNN and tested on the same datasets.
